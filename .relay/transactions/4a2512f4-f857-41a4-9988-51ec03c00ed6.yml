gitCommitMsg: 'fix(kimi): update selector for running state'
promptSummary: >-
  The user requested an update to the Kimi Chat selector to correctly identify
  the 'running' state. The previous selector was outdated. Based on the provided
  SVG element details, the distinguishing feature for the running state is an
  SVG with the attribute `name="stop"`. I have updated the selector in
  `public/sites.json` to `svg[name='stop']` to reflect this.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Based on the information you provided about the Kimi Chat interface, the
    previous selector for the stop button is no longer correct. I will update
    `public/sites.json` to use the `name` attribute of the SVG icon to detect
    when a process is running. The new selector will target `svg[name='stop']`,
    which accurately reflects the state you described.
