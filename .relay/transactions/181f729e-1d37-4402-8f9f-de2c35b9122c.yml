gitCommitMsg: 'fix(tsconfig): remove rootDir to resolve TS6059'
promptSummary: >-
  User received a TS6059 error because vite.config.ts was not under the
  specified rootDir in tsconfig.json. I am fixing this by removing the `rootDir`
  property, as Vite now controls the build structure, making the property
  redundant and causing a conflict.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Of course. My apologies, that TypeScript error is my mistake. It's a classic
    `tsconfig.json` pathing issue.
  - >-
    The error `File '.../vite.config.ts' is not under 'rootDir' '.../src'`
    occurs because the `tsconfig.json` file specified that all source files
    (`rootDir`) must be inside the `src/` directory, but I also asked it to
    type-check `vite.config.ts`, which lives at the project root.
  - >-
    The fix is to remove the `"rootDir": "./src"` setting. Your project's build
    process is now controlled by Vite, which correctly handles the source and
    output paths based on its own configuration (`vite.config.ts`). The
    `tsconfig.json` is primarily used for type-checking (`tsc --noEmit`) and
    editor support, so removing `rootDir` is safe and resolves the conflict.
  - 'Here is the patch for `tsconfig.json`:'
  - This single change should resolve the `tsc` error and allow you to proceed.
