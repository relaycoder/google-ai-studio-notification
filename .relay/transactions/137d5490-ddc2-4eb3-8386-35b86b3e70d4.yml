gitCommitMsg: 'fix(qwen): Update selector for stop button detection'
promptSummary: >-
  User wants to update the selectors for Qwen chat to correctly identify the
  processing state.
reasoning:
  - >-
    Okay, I see you're looking to update the selector for Qwen Chat to more
    accurately detect when a process is running. Based on the HTML snippets
    you've provided, the presence of an `<i>` element with the class
    `icon-StopIcon` inside a button is the key indicator.
  - >-
    I'll update the configuration in `src/content/sites.ts` to use this new,
    more accurate selector.
  - '### Step-by-step reasoning'
  - >-
    1.  **Analyze Request**: The goal is to fix process detection for Qwen Chat.
    The user has identified that the stop button contains `<i class="...
    icon-StopIcon ...">`.
  - >-
    2.  **Locate Target File**: The selectors for different websites are defined
    in `src/content/sites.ts`.
  - >-
    3.  **Identify Change**: The existing selector for Qwen Chat is `button >
    span[aria-label='stop']`. This needs to be replaced with a selector that
    matches the structure provided.
  - >-
    4.  **Formulate New Selector**: A robust selector for the stop button is
    `button i.icon-StopIcon`. This looks for a button containing an `<i>` tag
    that has the `icon-StopIcon` class.
  - >-
    5.  **Apply Change**: I will replace the old selector with the new one in
    the `sites` array for the 'Qwen Chat' entry. No other files need to be
    changed as the core logic in `App.tsx` correctly uses this selector to
    determine if a run has started or stopped.
  - 'Here is the required patch:'
  - >-
    This change will ensure the extension correctly detects when Qwen Chat is
    processing a request.
